# ns3-coAP

##

Here we include three parts of our research:

- A partial coAP implementation with several modifications like mDNS support and periodical multicast coAP discovery request.
- A simple multicast forwarding (SMF) algorithm using classic flooding (the simplest option)
- A script that performs the simulation with several modificable parameters
